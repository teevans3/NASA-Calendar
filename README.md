# NASA-Calendar

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This application is a calendar that utilizes NASA's api to retrieve both NASA's photo-of-the-day and near-earth asteroids for that day. Users can go far back in the past, seeing old photos-of-the-day and near-earth asteroids, or go far into the future and see near-earth asteroids (obviously, no photo-of-the-day yet though). Users can create events for specific days, which will show up on the calendar. There is also an option to take users to the current day, if they have navigated too far off. The only problem is that sometimes the photo-of-the-day is a collage of images/videos, which I cannot get to display properly. There is an API request limit of 1,000 per hour.
